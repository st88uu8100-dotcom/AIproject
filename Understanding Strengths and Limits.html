    <h1>Understanding Strengths and Limits</h1>
    <p>
      The first step wasn’t about mastering AI — it was about knowing what I didn’t know.

      <h2>Learning by Asking</h2>

      <p>
        When I started my site, I didn’t have all the answers.  
        I realized quickly that I couldn’t do everything alone. My coding skills were basic, design sense limited, and I had zero marketing experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I asked AI. Not for shortcuts, but for guidance on things I didn’t understand.  
        “How do I set up hosting?”  
        “What’s the best way to structure pages for clarity?”  
        “How can I make this content readable and engaging?”
      </p>

      <p>
        AI became a mirror — showing me where my knowledge ended and where I needed to focus.  
        Every time I hit a wall, I asked, learned, implemented, and repeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        I discovered that my strengths weren’t technical perfection or knowing all the answers.  
        They were curiosity, persistence, and the ability to learn quickly from tools around me.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, I accepted my limits: some tasks were tedious, some decisions required expertise I didn’t yet have, and some errors were inevitable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recognizing both strengths and limits helped me structure my workflow, focus my energy, and trust that the AI-assisted approach could carry me farther than brute force alone ever could.
