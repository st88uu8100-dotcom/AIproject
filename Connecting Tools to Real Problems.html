      Using AI alone isn’t enough — the real challenge is solving problems that matter.

      <h2>Seeing the Limits of AI</h2>

      <p>
        Initially, I tried to let AI handle everything — content, formatting, even testing ideas.  
        I thought this would save time and maximize results.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon, I noticed the limits. AI could generate polished outputs, but without context, the results often missed the real needs of my audience.  
        And sometimes, AI created solutions that looked cleaner or more compelling than what I could produce manually.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, that was frustrating — it felt like the AI was outperforming me.  
        But then I realized this was exactly the insight I needed: my goal wasn’t to compete with AI, it was to **use it to amplify my work**.
      </p>

      <p>
        The breakthrough came when I shifted my mindset: instead of creating everything myself, I focused on defining problems clearly, guiding AI to produce solutions, and iterating on what mattered most.  
        This allowed me to combine human judgment with AI efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        That moment marked the beginning of my systemized workflow — a loop where AI supports my decisions, speeds up execution, and lets me focus on connecting tools to real problems instead of trying to do it all alone.
