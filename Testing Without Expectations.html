    <h1>Testing Without Expectations</h1>
    <p>
      My first real attempt wasn’t strategic.  
      It was hopeful, naive — and completely silent.
    </p>

      <h2>The First Thing I Built</h2>

      <p>
        The first thing I decided to build was a website.
        It felt logical.
        A place to put ideas, AI-generated content, and the promise of “something scalable.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I spent two full weeks on it.
        Designing layouts.
        Writing copy.
        Tweaking details that no one would ever notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my head, launching meant momentum.
        I imagined clicks, feedback, maybe even the first sign of traction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, nothing happened.
        No comments.
        No messages.
        No signal that anyone had even seen it.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, it felt like failure.
        Two weeks of effort, condensed into silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        But looking back, that project taught me something critical.
        Building without distribution is just building for yourself.
        Effort doesn’t matter if it never reaches anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        That experience stripped away expectations.
        From then on, I stopped assuming that “good work” would speak for itself.
        I started treating everything as a test — not a verdict.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal wasn’t success anymore.
        The goal was learning what actually moves the needle.
