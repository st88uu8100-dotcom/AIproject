    <h1>Why I Started</h1>
    <p>
      This didn’t begin with AI.  
      It began with frustration, limits, and the feeling that effort wasn’t turning into progress.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>When Hard Work Wasn’t Enough</h2>

      <p>
        I wasn’t looking for shortcuts or overnight success.
        I was doing what most people do  working hard, trying to improve,
        and hoping that consistency would eventually pay off.
      </p>

      <p>
        But over time, something became painfully clear:
        no matter how much effort I put in, the results stayed flat.
        More work didn’t mean more freedom.
        More hours didn’t mean more security.
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt stuck in a loop where progress depended entirely on my presence.
        If I slowed down, everything slowed down.
        If I stopped, everything stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        That realization was uncomfortable.
        It forced me to admit that the problem wasn’t my motivation or discipline —
        it was the structure I was working within.
      </p>

      <p>
        I needed a way to make effort compound.
        A way to build something once and let it work repeatedly.
        A way to turn ideas into outcomes without trading every hour directly for money.
      </p>

      <p>
        That search is what led me here.
        AI wasn’t the goal 
        it was the first tool that made a different path feel possible.
